							<p>Yeah... I'm going to go ahead and assume that you just discovered anime very recently, thus I'll excuse that your ignorant ass just contradicted me on fact with your baseless dumbfuck opinion. Since you obviously have no idea how to look up anything and you have no concept of the typical creation/production mechanisms as well as relations between light novels, manga, anime and visual novels/games, I will take a moment to point you in the right direction.</p>
							<p>Fact: NO, this isn't based on the manga, it's based on the Light Novel; any reputable anime information source, even says "source material/original work: Light Novel". Also every anime information source or anime news source that announced the adaptation of this series, also said it was based on the light novel, INCLUDING the official Website for this series. So again, I'm just going to go ahead and also assume that google magic is far beyond your level of skills.</p>
							<p>Now, here's a little education for you, so try to learn something, so that next time you don't come off as such an ignorant douchebag contradicting FACT with I think duuuuuhh... So here's how it goes, any original creation, be it a novel, light novel, visual novel/game, manga or anime, if or when it becomes very popular and/or best selling will usually get multiple adaptations in other formats. Pop LN get manga, anime, game adaptations, Pop manga get LN, anime, game adaptations, Pop games get manga, LN, anime adaptations and so on, BUT these adaptations are almost always and exclusively based ON the ORIGINAL WORK, with very few exceptions (I'm not even going to bother getting into those exceptions, because I'm already suspecting that what I'm telling you may be beyond your level of understanding). Since all these adaptations are often or usually made by different groups in different fields, there are going to be a lot of differences between adaptations, thus basically any similarities between adaptations outside the original core story/characters are pretty much coincidental. In conclusion, contrary to fanfag ideology of how everything should be a Xerox copy of w/e original or adaptation they fap to incessantly, Xeroxing is really not how shit gets Produced.</p>
							<p>Hope that's not too complicated or "worked up" for you. (￣へ￣)</p>
